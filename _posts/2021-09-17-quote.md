  "if you are uncomfortable- in deep pain, angry, yearning, confused- you don't have a problem, you have a <em>life</em>.<br>
  Being human is not hard because you're doing it wrong, its hard because you're doing it <em>right</em>.<br> You will never change the fact
  that being human is  hard. so you must change your idea that it was ever supposed to be <b> easy </b>". <br>
  - Glennon Doyle, <em> Untamed </em>.
